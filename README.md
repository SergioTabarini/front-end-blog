# Your Blog

For this project, you must develop your own blog. It is important that you focus on developing the Blog as asked on the psd. If you want to add more functionalities and visual changes, do it on a new `branch`. On the `master branch`
the project must be the same as the specifications asked here, so that your project gets evaluated automatically.

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Open the design and analyse it
3. Write the code
4. Handing the project


## 1. Fork and clone the repository

**Fork** the repository for your user. You have to locally clone the repository. On the terminal you must write the following code:

```
git clone https://github.com/SergioTabarini/front-end-blog.git
```
Change *SergioTabarini* for your user name.

## 2. Open the design and analyse it

An image or a photoshop file from a designer is going to be your only guide when you work with a development team. This image is going to give you the guidelines you need to follow for the software. Open the image [blog-sketch](assets/mockup/frontend-blog.psd)
to see how your webpage is going to look like.


## 3. Write the code

Make sure you write all of your HTML code at [index.html](index.html) and all of you CSS code at  [styles.css](assets/css/style.css). Through code, you have to make the closest webpage possible to the blog-sketch image [blog-sketch](assets/mockup/frontend-blog.psd). 

### Write 3 posts
Now you have to write at least 3 posts.

## 4. HTML/CSS

Make sure you follow the PSD guidelines you better take this in consideration
	- Set a main container centered
	- Follow the same padding as in the psd
	- If you have doubt on the psd styles you can select the element, right click and select the option copy css this will give you important rules on css but be careful because we only use it for take shadows, borders etc.

### Advanced
Only when you finish the main page of the blog, you can continue with the advanced topics. Now make a search option using Javascript and JQuery that looks for the posts by the *query* and that returns the posts that contains the used words.

### Running the tests locally 

To make sure your code passes, you have to run tests on your computer. For this we are going to use a tool known as  [Gulp](http://www.gulpjs.com) that runs on [Node.JS](http://www.nodejs.org).

If you followed all the detailed steps in the [Pre-requisitos](1. Pre-requisitos), using the terminal go into the project folder and write the following commands:

```
npm -d install
```
After installing the modules run this command: 
```
gulp
```

## 5. Handing the project

To hand this project you must commit the changes and then push the project to your remote repository in Github.

### Commit and Push 

```
git add .
git commit -m 'The search option of the blog is working!'
```
Then we have to send the code to your Github repository

```
git push origin master
```

### Pull Requests

After making the changes in Github, you have to click on the **Pull Requests**
link that can be found on the Github page of your project. Follow the instructions that they give you there.

## 6. Feedback
